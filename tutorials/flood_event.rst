Flood Extent Mapping Tutorial
=========================================

Serivice Summary
-----------------------------------------

This service focuses on detecting floods over a period around a specific date (event start date) in a specific Area of Interest (AOI) defined by the user; it uses SAR and Optical Flood Extent Detection processors developed by CIMA Foundation. 
The user specifies an AOI and sets the start date of the flood event. 
A default observation/acquisition period is applied automatically, but it can be adjusted as needed. 
The service automatically searches pre- and post-event Sentinel-1 images with the same geometry and post-event Sentinel-2 images covering the AOI. 
The service extracts the Land Cover map and Water Bodies map in the same area and triggers the execution of the SAR Flood Extent Detection and Optical Flood Extent Detection for each satellite image found. 
As a result, flood extent maps are generated for each observation and a maximum extent map is provided as the cumulative sum of these maps.

Overview of the Specialized PE graphical interface
---------------------------------------------------

This section provides a general overview of the key components and layout of the Specialized Processing Environment (PE) user interface.
The main menu is always visible on the green bar on the left-hand side of the interface, allowing you to navigate through the various sections of the platform.

* **Workspaces**: each user can work in one or more Workspaces. A Workspace is a collection of files (either original Earth Observation (EO) data or outputs generated by processing tools) grouped under the same “project.” From the Workspace section, you can:
  
  * Create a new workspace
  * Open an existing workspace from the dropdown list of workspaces your account has access to

    Flood Extent Mapping Service User Interface

To begin, scroll to the bottom of the **Main Menu** and:

* **Select whether to run the app in a new workspace or an existing one.**
  
  * If you select **Existing Workspace**, a dropdown menu will appear, allowing you to choose from the workspaces you’ve already created.
  * If you choose **New Workspace**, you can either assign a custom name or let the system automatically generate one for you [Automatic Name].

Basic
"""""""

Fill **Basic** parameters (required as mandatory to run the app)

* **Flood Event Date**: Date when the flood event started. Post-event images will be searched starting from this date onward. 
* **Event Code**: Prefix to use to name output files. Do not use underscore.
* In the **Impacted Area** draw the area in which you want to make your analysis, e.g over the Mojana Region in Colombia.

Advanced
"""""""""""

In the Advanced Parameters section, you’ll find additional settings that can be modified by expert users. These parameters are not mandatory to run the app. 
The following options are available:

* *Days to search pre-event*: Number of days before the Flood Event Date to search for pre-event images (excluding the Flood Event Date). Default: 20 days
* *Days to search post-event*: Number of days after the Flood Event Date to search for post-event images (including the Flood Event Date). Default: 20 days
* *Delete*: Keep this option selected to delete intermediate files. Deselect it if you want to retain all intermediate files.
* *Apply permanent water*: The algorithm includes permanent water computation by default. Enable this option if you want to explicitly apply it to the output using a reference thematic layer.

AUTOWADE
"""""""""""

In the AUTOWADE tab, you can choose to run flood mapping using both SAR and optical data.

To enable this, select the “Run Optical Detection” option.

When this option is checked, the Flood Extent Mapping App will automatically launch both the autowade_S1 (SAR-based) and autowade_S2 (optical-based) processing workflows.

    FEM App – AUTOWADE tab with parameters for enabling optical flood mapping

In this section, you can set parameters to refine the search for images used in the application. 
The parameters you can adjust from their default values include:

* *Max Cloud Allowed per S2*: Specifies the maximum cloud coverage allowed for Sentinel-2 optical images to be considered in the analysis.
* *Min Coverage*: Defines the minimum percentage of a Sentinel-2 image that must cover the area of interest to be included.

Once all parameters are set, click the **“Run App”** button in the Main Menu. 
The platform will automatically redirect you to the workspace you selected—either an existing one or the newly created workspace.

* Comparative optical and SAR flood map. called [CODE]_[DATE]_frisk[DAYS] (Legend 2)

*Legend 1:*

0 - No data

1 - No flood

2- Permanent water

3 - Flooded areas

*Legend 2:*

0 - No Data 

1 - No Flood

2 - One Map flood, the other oe not flood

3 - One Map flood, the other one no data
