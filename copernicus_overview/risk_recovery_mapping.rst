The Risk and Recovery Mapping service
====================================================

The Risky and Recovery Mapping (RRM) is developed in the international context of the Sendai
Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. It aims to supply information
layers that support decision making in the emergency management phases
that are not directly related to response. The RRM focuses on the
information extraction for hazard and risk characterization in a range
of prevention, mitigation, preparedness and recovery contexts.

Emergency response is managed using the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS) Rapid Mapping service while
the RRM is supporting other phases of Disaster Risk Management (DRM) cycle, 
typically the phases
after the immediate disaster response including recovery,
rehabilitation, reconstruction and risk mitigation activities.
Therefore, the RRM service concerns the on-demand provision of
geo-spatial information in support to emergency management activities
during the phases of the disaster emergency management cycle which are
preceding (prevention or preparedness) or following (recovery phase) a
disaster event. In addition, the CEMS has a component called Early
Warning and Monitoring.

While both the Rapid Mapping service and the RRM service use satellite
imagery and other geospatial data there are some key differences between
them. The main difference is their focus and scope. Overall, Copernicus
Risk and Recovery Mapping has the goal to improve disaster response and
management in a complementary fashion to the immediate response phase
(days to weeks) by looking at both disaster recovery following the
emergency (weeks to months) and long-term risk mitigation efforts
outside an emergency basis.

Examples of CEMS Rapid Mapping include damage maps of
disaster-affected areas with information on the extent and severity of
the disaster, as well as the location of affected populations and
infrastructure. This information is used by emergency responders and
disaster management authorities to plan and coordinate response efforts.
These products are typically used in the immediate aftermath of a
disaster, when timely information is critical for saving lives and
minimizing damage.

The RRM service provides a range of different geoinformation products
such as mapping the potential impact of future disasters, allowing
authorities to take proactive measures to mitigate risks and minimize
the impact of future events. The RRM service provides detailed
information on the extent and severity of natural and man-made
disasters, as well as potential risks and vulnerabilities. This
information is used to plan and coordinate DRM activities including the
development of strategies for recovery and risk reduction. This includes
identifying areas that are at high risk of natural disasters such as
floods, landslides, and wildfires and characterizing the hazard
(susceptibility mapping). In addition, the RRM service supports
post-disaster recovery efforts by providing detailed information on the
extent of damage and the location of affected populations and
infrastructure, with more details than rapid mapping products and
generally with longer production time. This information can help
planning and prioritizing recovery efforts, including the allocation of
resources and the development of rebuilding plans. RRM is designed to
support both emergency response and long-term recovery efforts,
providing detailed information on a wide range of factors, while the
CEMS Rapid Mapping service is focused primarily on rapid response,
providing fast and accurate mapping products in the immediate aftermath
of a disaster.

Since 2012 the CEMS Risk and Recovery Mapping products have been
effectively used in risk reduction studies and recovery efforts for all
types of disasters or humanitarian crises around the world.

The Copernicus RRM combines standard Services and flexible i.e. tailored
services. Standard services comprise 20 different components divided
into nine categories from the list provided in the :doc:`dedicated section<list_of_services>`.

Overall, the Risk and Recovery activity provides information and
services relevant for supporting activities both on an emergency basis
(disaster response) and activities not on an emergency basis (e.g.
post-disaster recovery efforts, risk mitigation, preparedness, etc).
