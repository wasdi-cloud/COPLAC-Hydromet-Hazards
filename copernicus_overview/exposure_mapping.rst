The Exposure Mapping service
========================================================

The Copernicus Emergency Management Service (EMS) offers Exposure-related services that utilize EO data
to support risk assessments. These services include the provision of
geospatial information and maps that help identify and analyze elements
at risk, such as buildings, critical infrastructure, and land use. The
data and products provided by the Copernicus EMS can assist in
understanding the potential impacts of natural or man-made disasters on
these assets.

**The Copernicus EMS exposure mapping** component provides highly
accurate and continuously updated information on the presence of human
settlements and population with the Global Human Settlement Layer
(GHSL). It is Supported by the Joint Research Centre (JRC) and the DG
for Regional and Urban Policy (DG REGIO) of the European Commission,
together with the international partnership GEO Human Planet Initiative.

**The Global Human Settlement Layer** (GHSL, see:
https://ghsl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ ) provides detailed information on
disaster exposure to support crisis management and the assessment of
disaster risks. The scope of the exposure mapping component of the Copernicus EMS
is to provide, with the Global Human Settlements Layer, highly accurate
information derived from satellite and census data on the presence of
settlements and population. GHSL datasets are available globally and can
be downloaded for free by tile. They are available for different epochs
ranging from 1975-2030, as well as different coordinate systems. Not all
combinations of options are available i.e. some products are only
available at certain resolutions and/or certain years. The data is
downloaded by selecting the desired options then the tile on the map. A
global visualization of the data is also available as a map preview. The
different products available are Built-up surface (with height and
volume options), population gird (with settlement and functional urban
area options), and other more specific characteristics. **Population
grids** are effective datasets to assess the amount of resident
population at fine spatial resolution. Population counts per grid cell
quantify the amount of people exposed to hazards. Built-up surface grids
are essential information to map human settlements and their
characteristics (like land use and density). The amount of built-up
surface per grid cell is useful to estimate settlement typologies and is
used as covariate for population disaggregation.
