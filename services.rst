Services
=================

As part of its mission to enhance disaster risk management in Latin America and the Caribbean, the CopernicusLAC EO Service is creating a range of satellite-based applications that use Copernicus Sentinel data. 
These tools will become part of the future CopernicusLAC Panama Centre, offering regional users direct access to Earth observation services, data, and processing resources.

A key component of this initiative is the development of five flood-related mapping services, designed to support better assessment and response. These include:

   :maxdepth: 1

   high_level_description/flood_event
   high_level_description/flood_frequency
   high_level_description/flood_depth
   high_level_description/flood_hazard
