The Early Warning and Monitoring services
=========================================================

The Copernicus Emergency Management Service (EMS) Early Warning and Monitoring services include:

-  The European Flood Awareness System (EFAS) and the Global Flood
   Awareness System (GloFAS, see: https://www.efas.eu/en). These
   services combine satellite information, hydrological, modelling,
   meteorological predictions and in situ measurements. In addition, the
   Copernicus EMS provides a continuous global, systematic, and
   automated monitoring of all land surface areas possibly affected by
   flooding called global flood monitoring (GFM) product. (see:
   https://www.globalfloods.eu/technical-information/glofas-gfm/ ).

-  The European & Global Drought Observatories (EDO & GDO). The
   observatories gather drought-relevant information such as maps of
   indicators derived from different data sources and produce reports
   with detailed description on severe drought events (e.g.,
   precipitation measurements, satellite measurements, modelled soil
   moisture content, see:
   https://edo.jrc.ec.europa.eu/edov2/php/index.php?id=1000 ).

-  The European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS, see:
   https://effis.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ ) that lies in the integration and
   processing of multiple data sources, including satellite imagery, and
   converting them into real-time information on forest fire management,
   in complement to different national systems. The compatibility of
   EFFIS with national systems makes it flexible and adaptable to
   specific methodologies and needs.
