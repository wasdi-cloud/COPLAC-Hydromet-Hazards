About the CopernicusLAC Panama Centre
---------------------------------------

The Copernicus Latin America and Caribbean Panama Centre (CopernicusLAC Panama) is a regional hub which will enhance the 
resilience of the Latin America and Caribbean countries by supporting their spatial data management capacity and strategic 
use, in a region particularly vulnerable to climate change-induced weather events and geohazards.

Hydromet Hazards Services
---------------------------

The CopernicusLAC EO Service activities include the development of innovative services for disaster risk reduction 
based on Copernicus Sentinel satellite data. These services will be integrated into the future CopernicusLAC Panama Centre, 
which will provide users in Latin America and the Caribbean access to the information, services, and processing 
capabilities established by the Centre in the region.

Among the developed services, five of them will be dedicated to flood events. Specifically:

* :doc:`flood extent mapping <high_level_description/flood_event>`,
* :doc:`flood frequency mapping <high_level_description/flood_frequency>`,
* :doc:`flood depth mapping <high_level_description/flood_depth>`,
* :doc:`flood hazard mapping<high_level_description/flood_hazard>`.
* :doc:`urban flood mapping <detailed_description/urban_flood>`.
