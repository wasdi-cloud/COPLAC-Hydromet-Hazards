The Copernicus Emergency Management Service (EMS) is designed to support
Disaster Risk Management (DRM) regarding natural and man-made disasters both
during the emergency response phase and outside. It consists of geoinformation
products and services to better understand and manage disaster risks and is provided
by the European Union&#39;s Earth Observation Program, Copernicus. The Copernicus
EMS involves the implementation of different components, each having several
modules:

-  CEMS Mapping including Rapid Mapping; :doc:`Copernicus Risk and Recovery Mapping<risk_recovery_mapping>` (CEMS RRM); 
   Validation; Aerial component. The Rapid Mapping
   service and the Risk and Recovery Mapping are both EO based services.

-  :doc:`Early Warning and Monitoring<early_warning_monitoring>` with both EU wide and global services
   with monitoring and forecasting components. For instance, the
   European Drought Observatory (EDO) is continuously extended to the
   global scale (GDO for droughts); the same applies concerning Flooding
   and Forest Fires (GloFAS for floods, GWIS for forest fires).

-  :doc:`Exposure Mapping service<exposure_mapping>`; the goal is the periodic production of
   global geospatial information on human settlements in the form of
   built-up area grids.

National Disaster Management Authorities (NDMAs i.e. user organisations with
a mandate concerning DRM) are the primary requesters of the Copernicus EMS
services. NDMAs from outside Europe are able to activate the Copernicus EMS
through the Emergency Response Coordination Centre of the 
European Union (ERCC, https://erccportal.jrc.ec.europa.eu/).
